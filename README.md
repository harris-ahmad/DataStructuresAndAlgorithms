## Introduction

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of data structures implemented in C++, Go, JavaScript, and Python. Each implementation will include practical applications to demonstrate their usage in real-world scenarios.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the data structures, navigate to the respective directory and follow the instructions provided in the comments or documentation within the code.

### Example

Here‚Äôs a quick example to get you started with the Go Singly Linked List:

1. Navigate to the `go/LinkedList/singly` directory.
2. Ensure you have Go installed on your machine.
3. Run the example by executing:

```bash
go run LinkedList.go
```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! If you have implemented a data structure not listed here or have improved an existing implementation, please feel free to submit a pull request.

### How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-new-data-structure`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add new data structure'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-new-data-structure`).
5. Open a pull request.

Please ensure your code follows the style guidelines of the respective language and includes comments/documentation where necessary.
